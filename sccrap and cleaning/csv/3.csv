The purpose of this guidance is to provide recommendations to applicants and manufacturers on what tests should be performed and what documentation should be submitted or available to support the reformulation of drug products that use carbomers manufactured with benzene. Certain United States Pharmacopeia (USP) carbomer monographs currently allow for unacceptable levels of benzene, which raises safety concerns. FDA has requested that the USP omit (or remove) these monographs, and applicants and manufacturers may need to reformulate their drug products to avoid use of these carbomers. This guidance provides recommendations for tests and documentation related to reformulation based on various routes of administration and dosage forms of affected drug products, and provides recommendations for application holders on the appropriate submission types to notify the Agency of reformulation changes. The intended effect of this guidance is to, as appropriate, provide a less burdensome risk-based approach to reformulation submissions relative to existing guidances on scale-up and post-approval changes (SUPAC), and address the immediate public health need to expedite the discontinuation of the use of carbomers manufactured with high levels of benzene in drug products.","The Food and Drug Administration (FDA or Agency) is announcing the availability of a final guidance for industry entitled ""Reformulating Drug Products That Contain Carbomers Manufactured With Benzene.""

AD 2022-19-15 requires an angled ultrasonic inspection (AUSI) of the high-pressure turbine (HPT) 1st-stage disk and HPT 2nd-stage disk, and replacement if necessary. AD 2023-16-07 requires an AUSI of the HPT 1st-stage hub (also known as the HPT 1st-stage disk) and HPT 2nd-stage hub (also known as the HPT 2nd-stage disk) for cracks, and replacement if necessary, which is terminating action for AD 2022-19- 15. The NPRM was prompted by a manufacturer investigation that determined an increased risk of powder metal anomalies for all powder metal parts in certain powder metal production campaigns, which are susceptible to failure significantly earlier than previously determined. The NPRM would have retained the AUSI requirement for certain HPT 1st-stage and HPT 2nd-stage hubs from AD 2023-16-07. The NPRM would also have required performing an AUSI of the HPT 1st-stage hub, HPT 2nd-stage hub, high-pressure compressor (HPC) 7th-stage integrally bladed rotor (IBR-7), and HPC 8th-stage integrally bladed rotor (IBR-8) for cracks and replacement if necessary. The NPRM would also have required accelerated replacement of the HPC IBR-7, HPC IBR-8, HPC rear hub, HPT 1st-stage hub, HPT 1st-stage air seal, HPT 1st-stage blade retaining plate, HPT 2nd-stage hub, HPT 2nd-stage blade retaining plate, and HPT 2nd-stage rear seal. Since issuance of the NPRM, the FAA has received information that an error was inadvertently included in the compliance times for some of the HPT 1st-stage and 2nd-stage hubs, which would have required removal significantly later than necessary.

FRA selected the Project for funding under the Federal-State Partnership for Intercity Passenger Rail Program (FSP Program), and therefore, FRA's Buy America requirements apply to the Project. FRA's Buy America requirements include both FRA's statutory requirements, which require 100 percent of the manufactured products and steel and iron used in an FRA-funded project to be produced in the United States, and the Build America, Buy America Act (BABA), which requires that all construction materials used in the FRA-funded project be produced in the United States. FRA is not proposing to waive the applicable BABA requirements for construction materials used in the Project, and therefore this proposed waiver would not apply to the construction materials used in the Project. The proposed waiver would apply to the trainset, signal systems, high-speed rail turnout and fire alarm systems based on the domestic nonavailability of such components, as identified by NVDOT's railroad operating partner Brightline West and the two potential suppliers (Alstom and Siemens) of the rolling stock and signaling systems for the project.

The 2018 AHP Rule establishes an alternative set of criteria from those set forth in the Department's pre-rule guidance for determining when a group or association of employers is acting ""indirectly in the interest of an employer"" under section 3(5) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) for purposes of establishing an association health plan (AHP) as a multiple employer group health plan. The 2018 AHP Rule's alternative criteria were set aside in large part by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in New York v. United States Department of Labor. The district court found the bona fide association and working owner provisions in the rule to be an unreasonable interpretation of ERISA, inconsistent with congressional intent that ERISA applies to employee benefits arising out of employment relationships. The Department, after further review of the relevant statutory language, judicial decisions, and pre-rule guidance, and further consideration of ERISA's statutory purposes and related policy goals, now proposes to rescind in full the 2018 AHP Rule in order to resolve and mitigate any uncertainty regarding the status of the standards that were set under the 2018 AHP Rule, allow for a reexamination of the criteria for a group or association of employers to be able to sponsor an AHP, and ensure that guidance being provided to the regulated community is in alignment with ERISA's text, purposes, and policies.","This document proposes to rescind the Department of Labor's (Department or DOL) 2018 rule entitled ""Definition of Employer-- Association Health Plans"" (2018 AHP Rule).

This determination also serves as our 12-month finding on a petition to list the West Virginia spring salamander. After a review of the best available scientific and commercial information, we find that listing the species is warranted. We also propose to designate critical habitat for the West Virginia spring salamander under the Act. In total, approximately 3.5 kilometers (2.2 miles) in Greenbrier County, West Virginia, fall within the boundaries of the proposed critical habitat designation. We announce the availability of a draft economic analysis of the proposed designation of critical habitat for the West Virginia spring salamander.
