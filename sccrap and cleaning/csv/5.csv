NHTSA originally proposed to repeal the SAFE I Rule in a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking entitled ""Corporate Average Fuel Economy Preemption,"" which was published on May 12, 2021. After evaluating all public comments submitted for this Proposal, the Agency is finalizing the Proposal. As such, the Agency is repealing all regulatory text and appendices promulgated in the SAFE I Rule. In doing so, the Agency underscores that any positions announced in preambulatory statements of prior NHTSA rulemakings, including in the SAFE I Rule, which purported to define the scope of preemption under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA), do not reflect the Agency's reconsidered understanding of its proper role in matters of EPCA preemption. Through this final rule, NHTSA makes clear that no prior regulations or positions of the Agency reflect ongoing NHTSA views on the scope of preemption of states or local jurisdictions under EPCA.","This document finalizes NHTSA's proposal to repeal in full ""The Safer Affordable Fuel-Efficient (SAFE) Vehicles Rule Part One: One National Program,"" published September 27, 2019 (SAFE I Rule), in which NHTSA codified regulatory text and made...",Fuel economy,"This action is effective on January 28, 2022.",32,74236,74267,True,"Transportation Department, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration","492, 345","https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/transportation-department, https://www.federalregister.gov/agencies/national-highway-traffic-safety-administration","None, 492","transportation-department, national-highway-traffic-safety-administration","49, 49","531, 533"

The EAC Office of Grants Management (EAC/OGM) is responsible for distributing, monitoring and providing technical assistance to states and grantees on the use of federal funds. EAC/OGM also reports on how the funds are spent, negotiates indirect cost rates with grantees, and resolves audit findings on the use of HAVA funds. The EAC-PR has been developed for both interim and final progress reports for grants issued under HAVA authority. This revised format builds upon that report for the various grant awards given by EAC and provides terminology clarification. A ""For Comment"" version of the draft format for use in submission of interim and final Progress Reports is posted on the EAC website at: https://www.eac.gov/payments- and-grants/reporting. The PR will directly benefit award recipients by making it easier for them to administer federal grant and cooperative agreement programs through standardization of the types of information required in progress reports--thereby reducing their administrative effort and costs. After obtaining and considering public comment, the EAC will prepare the format for final clearance.

This determination also serves as our 12-month finding on a petition to list the foothill yellow-legged frog. After a review of the best scientific and commercial information available, we find that listing the South Sierra and South Coast DPSs as endangered and the North Feather and Central Coast DPSs as threatened is warranted. Accordingly, we propose to list these four DPSs under the Act, with the South Sierra and South Coast DPSs listed as endangered species, and the North Feather and Central Coast DPSs listed as threatened species. Our proposal to list the North Feather and Central Coast DPSs as threatened species also includes a rule issued under section 4(d) of the Act for each of these two DPSs. If we finalize this proposed rule for these four DPSs, we will then add them to the List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and extend the Act's protections to them.

In large part, the series of revisions for NAICS are designed to address decreasing usefulness of employing the mode of delivery (online versus in store/print) as an industry delineation criterion in the Wholesale Trade, Retail Trade, and Information sectors.

Therefore, the 2022 revisions to NAICS reflect a deemphasis on the delivery method as an industry function used in NAICS classification. In addition, OMB has accepted the ECPC recommendations with respect to biobased products manufacturing and renewable chemicals manufacturing topic areas, including the decision to continue research and outreach in this important emerging area.
